# aPhotoADay
Record a photo a day to watch something you love change over time, or remember a highlights of your day
Use the navigation bar at the top of the page to upload and/or view your daily photos. The << and >> symbols on the sides of this page will take you back or forward a day. You can also skip to a specific day by changing the date code in the URL (YYYYMMDD format). Selecting a date in the future will default to the current date, as at this time you cannot add photos for future dates.
